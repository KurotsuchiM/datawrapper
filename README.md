# Datawrapper Core

This is _Datawrapper Core_, the open source platform that powers the charting tools hosted as free service on [datawrapper.de](https://datawrapper.de).

Most of the functionality in Datawrapper is provided by plugins, [some of which are open source](https://github.com/datawrapper?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=plugin-&type=public&language=) but the majority is not. However, you are free to [create your own visualization plugins](https://github.com/datawrapper/datawrapper/wiki/Extending-Datawrapper).

Datawrapper was created by [Mirko Lorenz](http://www.mirkolorenz.com/), [Nicolas Kayser-Bril](http://nkb.fr) and [Gregor Aisch](http://driven-by-data.net/) and has in the past received funding by [ABZV](http://www.abzv.de/).
